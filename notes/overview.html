<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.1. </span>Birth with AI<a class="headerlink" href="#birth-with-ai" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Early ideas of machine language understanding were developed in building
translating machines.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1930s: Early proposals in machine translation by Georges Artsrouni
and Peter Troyanskii.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of NLP is to make machines understand human language, which is
an integral part of AI since its birth.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1950: Alan Turing proposed the famous Turing test as a criteria for
intelligence, where an interrogator tries to distinguish between a
computer and a real human through text-based conversation. Turing was
optimistic that a machine will pass the Turing test by the end of the
century and possess human thinking capability. We are obviously far
from that. But a more interesting question is, even if a machine
passes the Turing test, does it mean it has acquired human
intelligence? One famous objection is the “Chinese room” thought
experiment, where a “simulator” operates as if it knows Chinese but
obviously does not have any knowledge about language.</p></li>
<li><p>1954: Aside from the philosophical arguments, there is clear
practical motivation for working on NLP. Machine translation (MT) is
one such example. In fact, interests in building MT systems started
even before AI. The Georgetown-IBM experiment is the first public
demonstration of a MT system. It has six grammar rules and a
vocabulary of size 250, and was able to translate more than 60
sentences from Russian to English. The demonstration was widely
covered and encouraged subsequent funding in MT.</p></li>
<li><p>1964: ELIZA was the first chat bot that was able to attempt the
Turing test. Unlike the IBM-Georgetown experiment that was meant to
showcase the capability of machines, Elizabuilt was built by Joseph
Weizenbaum to demonstrate the superficiality of human-machine
communication. The bot was able to simulate a psychotherapist using
simple pattern matching, mostly just slightly rephrasing the
patients’ utterance. Nevertheless, many early users were convinced
that it has human intelligence. This is one example of ethical issues
arising with AI.</p></li>
<li><p>1970: Terry Winograd’s SHRDLU is another successful demonstration of
AI. It can interact with users in natural language and take actions
in “blocks world”. The system demonstrated advanced language
understanding skills in this simple world, e.g., grounding, question
answering, semantic parsing, coreference resolution, clarification
etc. Unfortunately, subsequent effort in scaling it up to more
complex settings failed, which is a common weakness of earlier AI
systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, researchers and funding agencies were overly optimistic
about the prospect of AI during the 50’s and 60’s: “Within the very near
future—much less than twenty-five years—we shall have the technical
capability of substituting machines for any and all human functions in
organizations.” Research at that time was largely focused on AI-complete
problems. In hindsight, it is evident that successes in the toy settings
were not going to transfer to even slightly more complex scenarios, but
most leading researchers at that time were convinced that AI would be
solved very soon.</p>

<div class="section" id="disappointing-results">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.2. </span>Disappointing results<a class="headerlink" href="#disappointing-results" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>However, progress was much slower than expected. Most early systems rely
heavily on logical reasoning in “toy” settings (e.g., small sets of
objects and words) and never scaled up to real systems.</p>
<p>In 1966, the ALPAC report concluded that MT was more expensive, less
accurate and slower than human translation, which led to a series
funding cut in AI research. This is known as the first AI winter. It was
hard to find funding for AI research in 70’s and research in MT was
abandoned for almost a decade.</p>
<p>The failure was due to several limitations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Limited computation. The hardware cannot handle the amount of
computation required in terms of memory and speed.</p></li>
<li><p>Combinatorial explosion. Most algorithms were based on logical
reasoning thus were intractable given exponentially growing search
spaces in complex problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Underestimated complexity. Researchers quickly realized the profound
difficulty in many problems, for example, word sense disambiguition
in machine translation. There may not be a principled solution using
logical reasoning.</p></li>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.3. </span>The rise of statistical methods<a class="headerlink" href="#the-rise-of-statistical-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the late 1980s, there was a rise of empirical/statistical methods due
to increased computation power and the lessening of the dominance of
Chomskyan theories of linguistics.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Notable progress in MT from IBM: For the first time, the translation
models use only parallel corpora and neglect knowledge of
linguistics. The IBM models form the basis of MT models until the
rise of deep learning approaches.</p></li>
<li><p>Statistical methods were widely adopted: perceptron, HMMs, SVMs etc.</p></li>
<li><p>“Every time I fire a linguist, the performance of the speech
recognizer goes up.”—Frederick Jelinek.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since 2011, neural networks / deep learning becomes the main driving
force in AI. - In 2015, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/COLI_a_00239">deep learning

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.5. </span>The tension between rationalism and empiricism<a class="headerlink" href="#the-tension-between-rationalism-and-empiricism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of NLP (and AI more broadly), there have been two
philosophically different approaches. Rationalists argue that knowledge
is gained through reasoning, thus data is not necessary. Empiricists
claim that knowledge is gained from experience <em>a posteriori</em>. The
dominant trend has swung back and forth between the two approaches. In
NLP, the main argument focus on the importance of linguistic knowledge
and machine learning (through data).</p>
<p>We are currently in the empiricism era. However, it is important to keep
in mind both perspectives in this course. The two approaches do not
conflict each other and we may find a way to reconcile them. Experience
is needed to test our reasoning and reasoning is needed in turn to
generalize our experience.</p>

<div class="section" id="challenges-in-nlp">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>Challenges in NLP<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges-in-nlp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Why is language hard? What are prominent features of NLP compared to
other fields in AI?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Discreteness</strong>: Unlike images and speech, text is symbolic. A
single word can carry lots of weight and decides the meaning of a
sentence, sometimes in a rather nuanced way. This makes it difficult
to define metrics and transformations for sentences. For example, we
can interpolate two images or to blur an image through deterministic
mappings, but corresponding operations for sentences cannot be easily
formalized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compositionality</strong>: The discrete symbols can be composed in
numerous ways to express different meanings. In addition,
Compositionality happens at all levels of language, e.g., words,
sentences, paragraphs, documents. Even in toy settings, we cannot
expect to see all possible compositions (think the blocks world).
This challenges the model to generalize from limited examples.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sparsity</strong>: Language has a long tail distribution (e.g., <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf’s
law</a>). Similar to
compositionality, the long tail distribution is observed at many
levels, e.g., word frequency, number of speakers per language, number
of utterances for a dialogue act etc. In most cases, it’s relatively
easy to get the common patterns correct, but it’s hard to cover rare
linguistic phenomena on the tail.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ambiguity</strong>: The same word / sentence can be interpreted
differently depending on the context, e.g., multi-sense word, PP
attachment, sarcasm.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will see these problems coming up again and again in the rest of this
course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="course-overview">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.3. </span>Course overview<a class="headerlink" href="#course-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will start with the representation of text, where the goal is to
represent strings as a “feature vector” that can be easily processed by
machine learning models. We would like a representation that is both
succinct, precise, and flexible.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Representation of text</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Symbolic representation</strong>. Text is represented as a set of
objects or concepts, e.g. the bag-of-words representation. The
symbolic representation is friendly to structures and logic,
however, the concepts often need to be defined for specific
domains.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Distributed representation</strong>. Text is represented as a list of
components or properties, i.e. dense vectors or embeddings. The
distributed representation is continuous and domain-independent,
thus it is attractive to modern ML models. However, the components
are often not interpretable and the lack of atomic concepts makes
it hard to use for logical reasoning.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many tasks in NLP are concerned with predicting structures, such as
sequences, trees, and graphs.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Predicting structures</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Modeling: how do we model interactions among substructures? For
example, if we are prediction a tree, the label of one node will
affect its children.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning: how do we learn the parameters of the model from labeled
/ unlabeled data? The common framework is to learn a scoring
function such that correct structures are scored higher than the
rest. However, we need to do this efficiently given an
exponentially large set of possible structures.</p></li>
<li><p>Inference: how do we compute the best structure efficiently given
the combinatorial output space? This is a search problem and we
will often resort to dynamic programming.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, the key challenge in answering these questions lies in
the fact that we are dealing with an exponentially large output space.</p>
<p>Modern approaches to NLP are largely based on neural networks, which
enabled unified approaches for many applications in NLP that used to be
relatively disconnected.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Neural networks for NLP</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Encoder-decoder modeling for structured prediction and text
generation. The encoder-decoder model (also called
sequence-to-sequence model) is extremely general and has been
applied to a wide range of tasks. The encoder takes the input
(images, tables, text etc.) and produces an embedding (dense
vector). For structured prediction, the simpliest decoder would be
a recurrent neural network provided that the output structure can
be “linearized”, i.e. convert to a sequence, which works
surprisingly well even for trees.</p></li>
<li><p>The paradigm of pre-training and then fine-tuning. The increasing
amount of data and compute has proven to be extremely powerful. We
can pre-train the model on tons of data by self-supervised
learning (i.e. no annotation is needed), and only fine-tune the
learned weights on the task we care about and obtain better
results than learning from scratch.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we will briefly touch on discourse and grounding, which go
beyond individual sentences.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Discourse and grounding</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discourse: what is the communication goal of the text? Discourse
studies the <em>coherence</em> of a collection of sentences. Roughly
speaking, a piece of text is coherent if we understand what it
does after reading it; the text could be telling a story, putting
forward an argument, or conversing about a topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Grounding: how do we relate language to the world? Grounding
establishes the connection between text and the perceptible world.
At the philosophical level, one may argue that real understanding
cannot be achieved by text alone without connecting it with the
real world. Regardless of the philosphical arguments, grounding is
very useful in task-oriented dialogue and human-robot interaction.
More generally, the “world” here doesn’t have to be the real world
that we can see and feel, it can be simply a set of objects of
interet that can be referred to by language.</p></li>
